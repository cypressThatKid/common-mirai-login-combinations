# common-mirai-login-combinations
I have gathered a set of commonly used usernames and passwords on Mirai Botnets. These are from Mirai's that were breached with weak database credentials, other leaks, public information and more. It is worth noting that there are multiple slurs, derogatory and curse words as the usernames and passwords. This is for education purposes, use this responsibly!
